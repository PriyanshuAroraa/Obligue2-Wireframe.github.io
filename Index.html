          <p class="text"><br>We graduated from high school on June 20th, 2021. We went there all three years and made a lot of memories. <br> We would have had even more of them hadn´t it been for the pandemic. <br> It was sad having to say goodbye to everyone, but we were excited to see what the upcoming semester was going to hold. <br> To the left we have Saqlain, in the middle its Priyanshu. We are the two members of the group. <br> To the right is one of our closest friends Roshaan.</p>

        <p class="text">This picture contains Saqlain and his litte niese who had visited from England. <br> They went to Hunderfossparken which is located in Lillehammer, Norway. <br> The park has a lot of rides both for kids and adults, clearly shown in the picture. <br> On the way to Lillehammer from Oslo you drive by Bolleland, supposedly the best bakery in Norway. <br> As you almost can see in the picture, my parents forced me to take this ride with my niece but it actually was kind of scary. <br> I am very scared of rides like this!

        <p class="text">This picture is of Priyanshu’s two little cousins from their trip on Color Line this summer. <br> The trip takes roughly two days with a pit stop in Kiel, Germany. <br> In Kiel you get two hours to do what you want, we decided to go eat from a famous German restaurant named Istanbul. <br> They served delicious meals, and on the way back to Oslo the weather was amazing. <br> Definitely one of the highlights this summer.</p>

        <p class="text">This picture is of Saqlain and his little nephew. <br> This was simply one of the days where the weather was immaculate. <br> It was hot and sunny so me and my family decided to take the kids out to have some fun, <br> it is safe to say that the task was accomplished. We bought some ice cream and fired up the barbeque. <br> Unfortunately this was on of the last days of the summer, <br> and I was kind of sad that the summer vacations was about to end, and that school would soon start.

      <p class="text">On the 11. August, Priyanshu´s cousin was born. <br> This is actually funny, beacuse that is the same date that i was born too. <br> His name is Aryan, and this was a pretty special day because it was the first child of my uncle and aunt. <br> This picture is taken at A-hus in Lørenskog, and i remember that day very well, <br> because everyone of mye family members was telling me that the next one in the family to have a child would be me...</p>

      <p class="text">In August we went to Tjøme with some of our friends from high school. <br> Considering it was only a week until university was starting, we decided we wanted to keep the trip in Norway. <br> Tjøme was simply beautiful, we had lots of fun. <br> In the morning we borrowed canoes and sailed on the perfectly still water. <br> In the evening we fired up the barbeque and enjoyed the sunset.</p>
